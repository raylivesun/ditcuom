‚Å†üîíÔΩúblocklists Big Improvements - Finally Done
'Hosts' old channel name

:warn:  Information you need to know:
Applying all lists won't give you a better browsing experience! 
Try to use at least lists as possible. (or use the default preset) 
Using big lists system wide (hosts file) is also not recommended 
- if you're planning to use a big list, do that via e.g. uBO 
(even if the list is compatible with the hosts file). If you still 
want to use a blocklist system wide you have to compress the 
blocklist with this tool, if it's not compressed yet.

Changes/Improvements:
It now uses the official links that are constantly updating
Removed outdated lists & added new ones
Added a two links (if possible) - first for the browser - second for the hosts 
file
Some lists can be used within the hosts file, but you have to compress them
Each option has a short description (channel)
List format improved
There's now a option do open the source link via the script
As some blocklists won't work with the hosts file, you're now able to copy 
the URLs 
It copies the selected options to your clipboard
Whole import process got revamped
And much more... take a look into the channel

It is highly recommended to use at least a light protection blocklists 
within your browser.
