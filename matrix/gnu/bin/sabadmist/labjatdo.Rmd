Okay, let's break down how to manage global options in R using the `options()` function.

**Core Function: `options()`**

The `options()` function is the primary tool in R for both examining and setting global options. These options influence a wide range of behaviors, from how numbers are printed to how errors are handled and where packages are downloaded from.

**How to Use `options()`**

1.  **View All Current Options:**
    *   Simply call the function with no arguments. This will return a named list containing *all* currently set options and their values. The list can be quite long!
    *   ```R
      options()
      # This will print a long list of option names and their current values.
      ```

2.  **View Specific Option(s):**
    *   Provide the names of the options you want to see as character strings.
    *   ```R
      # View the current setting for number of digits to display
      options("digits")
      # $digits
      # [1] 7

      # View the settings for console width and prompt character
      options("width", "prompt")
      # $width
      # [1] 80  # (Example value, might differ on your system)
      #
      # $prompt
      # [1] "> "
      ```
    *   **Alternatively, use `getOption()`:** This function is specifically designed to retrieve the value of a *single* option directly, rather than returning a list. This is often preferred within functions or scripts when you just need the value.
    *   ```R
      getOption("digits")
      # [1] 7

      # Compare:
      opts <- options("digits") # Returns a list
      val <- getOption("digits") # Returns the value directly
      print(class(opts))
      print(class(val))
      ```

3.  **Set Option(s):**
    *   Provide arguments in the form `option_name = new_value`.
    *   When you set options, the `options()` function *invisibly returns* a list containing the *previous* values of the options you just changed. This is extremely useful for temporarily changing settings and restoring them later.
    *   ```R
      # --- Setting a single option ---

      # Check current digits setting
      getOption("digits")

      # Set digits to 3
      old_opts <- options(digits = 3) # Store the old value(s)

      # Check the new setting
      getOption("digits")
      print(pi) # Now prints with fewer digits

      # Restore the original setting(s)
      options(old_opts)
      getOption("digits")
      print(pi) # Prints with original precision


      # --- Setting multiple options ---

      # Set console width to 100 and turn off scientific notation penalty
      old_opts_multi <- options(width = 100, scipen = 999)

      # (Do some work here that benefits from these settings)
      print(1e10) # Should avoid scientific notation

      # Restore original settings
      options(old_opts_multi)
      getOption("width")
      getOption("scipen")
      print(1e10) # May revert to scientific notation
      ```

**Commonly Used Options (Examples)**

*   **`digits`**: Controls the number of significant digits to print for numeric values. (Default: 7)
*   **`scipen`**: A penalty affecting whether R uses fixed or scientific notation for numbers. Higher positive values favour fixed notation; higher negative values favour scientific notation. (Default: 0)
*   **`width`**: The preferred width (number of columns) for printing output to the console. Affects how data frames, summaries, etc., are wrapped.
*   **`stringsAsFactors`**: **(Important History!)** Prior to R 4.0.0, the default was `TRUE`, meaning character vectors were often automatically converted to factors when creating data frames. From R 4.0.0 onwards, the default is `FALSE`. You can set this globally if needed for compatibility or specific workflows.
*   **`repos`**: Specifies the repository (CRAN mirror) URL(s) used by `install.packages()` and `update.packages()`. Often set to a specific mirror or `@CRAN@` to use the main redirector.
*   **`error`**: Determines what R does when an error occurs. Can be set to functions like `recover` or `dump.frames` for debugging. (Default: `NULL`, which stops execution and prints the error).
*   **`warn`**: Controls how warnings are handled. `0` defers printing until the top-level function returns, `1` prints them immediately, `2` turns warnings into errors. (Default: 0)
*   **`prompt`**: The primary prompt string used in the interactive console. (Default: `"> "`)
*   **`continue`**: The continuation prompt string used when a command spans multiple lines. (Default: `"+ "`)
*   **`max.print`**: Limits the maximum number of entries that will be printed for large vectors or lists, preventing the console from being flooded.

**Best Practice: Temporary Changes**

It's generally **bad practice** to change global options permanently within a script or function unless that's the script's explicit purpose (like setting up an environment). If you need specific settings for a piece of code, use the pattern shown above:

```R
# Store current settings
old_options <- options(digits = 4, scipen = 10)

# --- Your code that needs these specific settings ---
result <- some_calculation(x, y)
print(result)
# --- End of specific code ---

# Restore original settings **reliably**
options(old_options)

# The rest of your script uses the original R settings
```

This ensures your code doesn't have unintended side effects on other parts of the R session or other scripts run later.
